  Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
</p>

I'm Sankalp, a Machine Learning Practitioner.

### What do I do?

I mostly think about different ways to apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. To that extent, I love brainstorming ideas with businesses to find areas where machine learning can be adopted, and work closely with their technical teams in their ML journey towards building a proof-of-concept.


Thanks for reading!
